## What is Contract Testing

- [ ] Contract testing vs integrated end-to-end testing
- [ ] Contract testing vs functional testing
- [ ] Types of contract testing: consumer-driven, bi-directional, provider-driven etc.

## Consumer-Driven Contract Testing

- [ ] Consumer-driven contract testing as a collaboration technique
  - Fostering clear lines of communication and collaboration, between microservices and teams that consume them
  - Consumer-driven contract tests make communication between the teams explicit.
  - The explicit reminder of [Conwayâ€™s Law](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ConwaysLaw.html).
  - Agile stories are often referred to as a placeholder for a conversation. CDCs are just like that

## Example Application Architecture (C4)

The example application is a made-up e-commerce system built as microservices.

### System Context Diagram

![System context diagram](docs/architecture/c4/level_1_system_context/ecommerce_system_context.png)

### Container Diagram

![Container diagram](docs/architecture/c4/level_2_container/ecommerce_system_container.png)

## Using Pact for Testing the Example Application

In this example application, the [Pacticipant](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/advanced_topics/pacticipant)
names follow the convention `<application-name>--<communication-protocol>`.
For example, `service-customers--rest` is a `service-customers` application communicating over REST (synchronous HTTP),
and `service-customers--sns` is a `service-customers` application communicating over SNS (asynchronous messaging).

The need to name Pacticipants depending on the communication protocol is because Pact uses
different mechanisms for verifying contracts depending on whether it's a synchronous HTTP-based protocol or asynchronous messaging.
Pact HTTP contract tests use `pact.Verifier`, and Pact asynchronous messaging contract tests use `pact.MessageProvider`,
and they can't be mixed.

- List of the example application's Pacticipants:
  - `frontend--graphql`
  - `frontend--rest`
  - `service-customers--rest`
  - `service-customers--sns`
  - `service-order-history--graphql`
  - `service-order-history--sns`
  - `service-orders--rest`
  - `service-orders--sns`

### Run Pact Contract Tests locally with self-hosted Pact Broker

From [Pact Broker Introduction](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker) page on Pact documentation website:

> The Pact Broker is an application for sharing consumer driven contracts and verification results.
> The Pact Broker is an open source tool that requires you to deploy, administer and host it yourself.

- Install Pact CLI - [complete installation instruction on GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby-standalone/releases).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby-standalone/master/install.sh | PACT_CLI_VERSION=v2.0.10 bash
```

- Install Python dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

```bash
poetry install --with dev
poetry shell
```

- Set PYTHONPATH to include `src` directory.

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=src:$PYTHONPATH
```

- Run example application and Pact Broker locally with Docker Compose.

```bash
docker compose up
```

- Open local Pact Broker UI - <http://localhost:9292>.
  Login with `pactbroker`/`pactbroker` credentials.
  The list of contracts should be empty because we haven't run any tests yet.

- Run `consumer` tests first (remember about consumer-driven).
  Pact will generate contract files and save them in the `pacts` directory.

```bash
poetry run pytest -m "consumer"
```

- Pact Broker UI (<http://localhost:9292>) should still be empty because
  we haven't published contracts from `pacts` directory to the Pact Broker yet.

- Publish contracts from the `pacts` directory to the local Pact Broker.
  **Note: don't store your Pact Broker credentials in plain text;** this project is just an example.

```bash
pact-broker publish --auto-detect-version-properties \
    --broker-base-url http://localhost:9292 \
    --broker-username pactbroker \
    --broker-password pactbroker \
    pacts
```

- Refresh Pact Broker UI (<http://localhost:9292>) and you should see the list of contracts.
  Notice that `Last Verified` column is empty because the contracts haven't been verified
  against the `providers` yet.

![Pact Broker - contracts are not verified](docs/pact/01-pact-broker.png)
_Pact Broker - contracts are not verified_

- Verify `provider` contracts from the local Pact Broker.
  The Pact `provider` tests will fetch the latest contracts from the Pact Broker and run the tests against them.
  Verification results will be published back to the Pact Broker
  because `PACT_PUBLISH_VERIFICATION_RESULTS` environment variable is set to `true`.
  Usually, you would publish test results to the Pact Broker only in the CI/CD pipeline,
  so when working on a production project, omit the environment variable when running tests locally.

```bash
PACT_PUBLISH_VERIFICATION_RESULTS=true poetry run pytest -m "provider"
```

- Refresh Pact Broker UI (<http://localhost:9292>) and you should that all contracts have been verified.

![Pact Broker - contracts are verified](docs/pact/02-pact-broker.png)
_Pact Broker - contracts are verified_

### Run Pact Contract Tests with PactFlow.io

PactFlow.io is a SaaS version of Pact Broker. It has a free tier for up to 5 integrations,
which is suitable for a proof-of-concept. Read more about PactFlow in the [PactFlow documentation](https://docs.pactflow.io/).

- Create a free account on <https://pactflow.io>

- Generate [read/write API token](https://docs.pactflow.io/#configuring-your-api-token) for your PactFlow account
  and set environment variables:

```bash
export PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL=https://<your-account-name>.pactflow.io
 export PACT_BROKER_TOKEN=<your-read-write-api-token>
```

- Remove previously generated contracts from the `pacts` directory.

```bash
rm -r pacts/*.json
```

- Run `consumer` tests. This time, include `pactflow` marker to run only a subset of tests,
  since the PactFlow free tier has a limit of 5 integrations.

```bash
poetry run pytest -m "consumer and pactflow"
```

- Publish contracts from the `pacts` directory to the PactFlow. Notice that we don't need to specify
  Pact Broker URL and credentials because they are already set in the environment variables.

```bash
pact-broker publish --auto-detect-version-properties pacts
```

![PactFlow - contracts are not verified](docs/pact/03-pactflow.png)
_PactFlow - contracts are not verified_

- Verify Pacts and publish verification results.
  Usually, you would publish test results to the Pact Broker only in CI/CD pipeline,
  so when working on a production project, omit the environment variable when running tests locally.

```bash
PACT_PUBLISH_VERIFICATION_RESULTS=true pytest -m "provider and pactflow"
```

## Running Pact in a Deployment Pipeline (CI/CD)

For a complete guide of integrating Pact into your CI/CI workflow, take a look at
[Pact documentation - CI/CD setup guide](https://docs.pact.io/pact_nirvana).

The Pact guide covers more than just configuring Pact in the CI/CD pipeline,
but first getting the team aligned on the process of contract testing,
and getting started with the simplest and non-intrusive setup that will let
you evaluate if Contract Testing and Pact are a good fit for your project.

Since contract testing is a collaboration technique, it's important to get the team on board
first, before introducing mandatory blocking steps to the deployment pipeline.

> Contracts are not a replacement for good communication between or within teams.
> In fact, contracts require collaboration and communication.

A short summary of topics covered by the [Pact CI/CD setup guide](https://docs.pact.io/pact_nirvana):

1. Learn about Pact, talk, and get team alignment to try it out
2. Get a single test working manually.
3. Manually integrate with Pact Broker/PactFlow.
4. Integrate Pact Broker/PactFlow into the deployment pipeline.
5. Use [Can-I-Deploy](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/can_i_deploy)
   to verify if the version of your application you're about to deploy
   is compatible with other applications that are already deployed in that environment
   (not covered in this example project).
6. Record deployments and releases to the Pact Broker/PactFlow
   (not covered in this example project).

### Setting up the Deployment Pipeline for the Example Application

From [github.com/pactflow/example-provider](https://github.com/pactflow/example-provider):

> **When using Pact in a CI/CD pipeline, there are two reasons for a Pact verification task to take place:**
>
> - When the Consumer changes - to see if the Provider is compatible with the new expectations
> - When the Provider changes - to make sure it does not break any existing Consumer expectations

**The important part is to establish quick feedback loops for the changes in the contract:**

- Trigger the Provider Contract tests in the Provider CI/CD pipeline when a new Consumer contract version is published.
- Get notified that changes in your Consumer contract are incompatible with the existing Provider contract,
  i.e. the Provider contract tests failed in the Provider CI/CD pipeline.
- Before deploying a new version of the Consumer, verify that it's compatible with the currently deployed
  version of the Provider. Using [Can-I-Deploy](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/can_i_deploy) is one way of doing it.

The example application uses GitHub Actions for running the deployment pipeline.
Implemented workflow examples with PactFlow and GitHub Actions are in [.github/workflows/](.github/workflows/).
There're two deployment pipeline workflows:

- [build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml) - a regular deployment pipeline workflow that runs on every commit.
  It builds and tests the application, including running Pact contract tests.
- [pact-verify-provider-contract.yml](.github/workflows/pact-verify-provider-contract.yml) - a workflow
  that's triggered by a webhook from Pact Broker/PactFlow when a new Consumer contract version is published.
  The workflow runs the Provider contract tests against the new Consumer contract version and publishes
  the verification results back to the Pact Broker/PactFlow.

The examples in this project don't go the full way of setting up the deployment pipeline
using [Can-I-Deploy](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/can_i_deploy) and recording deployments and releases.
The concrete implementation will differ depending on the existing CI/CD setup and adopted ways of working.

For more examples, see:

- <https://github.com/pactflow/example-consumer>
- <https://github.com/pactflow/example-provider>

#### When the Consumer Changes

- On a new Consumer contract version - verify it against the Provider
  ([.github/workflows/pact-verify-provider-contract.yml](.github/workflows/pact-verify-provider-contract.yml)).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Consumer as Consumer CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
    participant PactBroker as Pact Broker/PactFlow
    participant Provider as Provider CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

    activate Consumer
    Consumer->>Consumer: On commit: run Pact contract tests with 'pytest'
    Consumer->>PactBroker: Pytest: publish new contract version
    deactivate Consumer

    activate PactBroker
    PactBroker->>Provider: Webhook: 'Consumer' contract requiring verification published
    deactivate PactBroker

    activate Provider
    Provider->>PactBroker: Pytest: fetch new Consumer contract version
    Provider->>Provider: Pytest: 'run Pact Provider contract tests' against Provider's 'main' branch
    Provider->>Provider: Pytest: provider contract tests passed
    deactivate Provider

    activate PactBroker
    Provider->>PactBroker: Pytest: publish successful verification results
    PactBroker->>PactBroker: Mark contract as verified
    deactivate PactBroker
```

- On a new Consumer contract version - verification against the Provider failed.
  ([.github/workflows/pact-verify-provider-contract.yml](.github/workflows/pact-verify-provider-contract.yml)).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Consumer as Consumer CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
    participant PactBroker as Pact Broker/PactFlow
    participant Provider as Provider CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

    activate Consumer
    Consumer->>Consumer: On commit: run Pact contract tests with 'pytest'
    Consumer->>PactBroker: Pytest: publish new contract version
    deactivate Consumer

    activate PactBroker
    PactBroker->>Provider: Webhook: 'Consumer' contract requiring verification published
    deactivate PactBroker

    activate Provider
    Provider->>PactBroker: Pytest: fetch new Consumer contract version
    Provider->>Provider: Pytest: 'run Pact Provider contract tests' against Provider's 'main' branch
    Provider->>Provider: Pytest: provider contract tests failed
    deactivate Provider

    activate PactBroker
    Provider->>PactBroker: Pytest: publish failed verification results
    PactBroker->>PactBroker: Mark contract verification as failed
    deactivate PactBroker
```

- On a commit in Consumer repository, but Consumer contract hasn't changed -
  automatically mark it as verified in Pact Broker/PactFlow without running the Provider contract tests.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Consumer as Consumer CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
    participant PactBroker as Pact Broker/PactFlow
    participant Provider as Provider CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

    activate Consumer
    Consumer->>Consumer: On commit: run Pact contract tests
    Consumer->>PactBroker: Pytest: publish new contract version
    deactivate Consumer

    activate PactBroker
    PactBroker->>PactBroker: Contract hasn't changed
    PactBroker->>PactBroker: Mark contract as verified
    deactivate PactBroker
```

#### When the Provider Changes

- On a new commit in Provider repository - verify Provider contract against Consumer contracts from Pact Broker/PactFlow
  ([.github/workflows/build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml)).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Provider as Provider CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
    participant PactBroker as Pact Broker/PactFlow
    participant Consumer as Consumer CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

    activate Provider
    Provider->>Provider: On commit: run Pact contract tests with 'pytest'
    Provider->>PactBroker: Pytest: fetch Consumer contracts from 'main' branch or latest deployed version
    Provider->>Provider: Pytest: 'run Pact Provider contract tests' against Provider's current branch
    Provider->>Provider: Pytest: provider contract tests passed
    Provider->>PactBroker: Pytest: publish successful verification results
    Provider->>Provider: GitHub Actions: mark build as successful
    deactivate Provider
```

- On a new commit in the Provider repository - Provider contract verification failed
  ([.github/workflows/build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml)).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Provider as Provider CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
    participant PactBroker as Pact Broker/PactFlow
    participant Consumer as Consumer CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

    activate Provider
    Provider->>Provider: On commit: run Pact contract tests with 'pytest'
    Provider->>PactBroker: Pytest: fetch Consumer contracts from 'main' branch or latest deployed version
    Provider->>Provider: Pytest: 'run Pact Provider contract tests' against Provider's current branch
    Provider->>Provider: Pytest: provider contract tests failed
    Provider->>PactBroker: Pytest: publish failed verification results
    Provider->>Provider: GitHub Actions: mark build as failed
    deactivate Provider
```

### Configuring Pact Broker/PactFlow with Terraform

Setting up Pacticipants and their webhook configurations in Pact Broker/PactFlow manually
is tedious and error-prone, especially when you're growing the number of services and teams.

You can use [Pact Broker Terraform Provider](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/terraform_provider)
to automate the configuration of Pact Broker/PactFlow.

The example project uses Terraform for automating the configuration of PactFlow:

- Creation of user accounts and teams.
- Creation of Pacticipants.
- Configuration of Webhooks.

See [terraform-pactflow/](terraform-pactflow/) directory for the example Terraform configuration.

## Testing Breaking Changes in Contracts with Pact

In this section we'll test that Pact detects breaking changes in both the Consumer and Producer contracts,
and observe how PactFlow displays the results.
See [Run Pact Contract Tests with PactFlow.io](#run-pact-contract-tests-with-pactflowio) section for getting
started with PactFlow.

### Breaking Consumer Contract

Taking `service-customers--sns` as an example consumer. We'll change the expectation about
the `order_total.units` format. Currently it expects a `string` value, but we'll change it to `integer`.

- In the [test_sns_consumer_contract\_\_orders.py](tests/customers/test_sns_consumer_contract__orders.py),
  change `order_total.units` from `string` to `integer`. Protobuf will still serialize the value as a `string`,
  but the contract will expect an `integer`, which will cause the contract test to fail.

```diff
--- a/tests/customers/test_sns_consumer_contract__orders.py
+++ b/tests/customers/test_sns_consumer_contract__orders.py
@@ -70,7 +70,7 @@ async def test_consume_order_created_event(
         "order_id": Term(Format.Regexes.uuid.value, "cc935616-e439-45a9-89ed-c6ef32bbc59e"),
         "order_total": Like(
             {
-                "units": "100",
+                "units": 100,
                 "nanos": 990000000,
             }
```

- Commit the changes under a new branch, e.g. `test/break-consumer-contract`.
  This will trigger the deployment pipeline and the new contract version will be published to PactFlow.

![PactFlow - contract is in the Unverified state](docs/pact/05-pactflow-breaking-consumer-contract.png)
_PactFlow - contract is in Unverified state_

If the PactFlow is configured to work in a CI/CD pipeline as per the example in
[Running Pact in a Deployment Pipeline (CI/CD)](#running-pact-in-a-deployment-pipeline-cicd) section,
the new Consumer contract version will trigger `contract requiring verification published` event in PactFlow.
The PactFlow event will send a webhook to GitHub, which will trigger the
[pact-verify-provider-contract.yml](.github/workflows/pact-verify-provider-contract.yml) GitHub Actions workflow.

The workflow will run the Provider contract tests against the new Consumer contract version and publish the verification results.
This process should happen automatically, and the `service-customers--sns` Consumer team shortly will be notified
that their changes are incompatible with the existing `service-orders--sns` Provider contract.

- The workflow in the Provider repository will fail with the following error:

```diff
Diff
--------------------------------------
Key: - is expected
    + is actual
Matching keys and values are not shown

{
  "order_total": {
-    "units": Integer
+    "units": String
  }
}

Description of differences
--------------------------------------
* Expected an Integer (like 100) but got a String ("123") at $.order_total.units
```

This should spark a conversation between the teams (or colleagues on the same team if their own the Provider service)
about the changes in the contract and the best way to proceed with the changes.

![PactFlow - contract is in the Failed state](docs/pact/06-pactflow-breaking-consumer-contract.png)
_PactFlow - contract is in the Failed state_

- To fix the contract, change `order_total.units` back to `string`, commit and push the changes to GitHub.
  This time, the `contract requiring verification published` event won't be triggered,
  because the Consumer contract returned to its previous state and has been already verified,
  so triggering the Provider contract verification is not necessary.

### Breaking Provider Contract

... TODO

## Limitations and Corner Cases

- Pacticipant name must include a communication protocol, .e.g `--rest` or `--sns`.
  Due to Pact handling synchronous HTTP and asynchronous messaging contract tests differently,
  they can't be mixed in the same Pacticipant.

- Due to the above, a single service can have multiple Pacticipants, one for each communication protocol
  the service supports. To run tests against the specific protocol, e.g. in the case
  when a Consumer contract has changed and you need to verify it against the specific Provider's protocol,
  you would need to use `pytest` markers and test selectors (`pytest -m "orders__sns"`).
  This is implemented in this example project.

- GraphQL contract testing with python-pact - queries and mutations must be formatted in the same way as in the contract,
  including spaces and new lines, otherwise Pact Mock Server would not be able to match the request body
  (when the request is not JSON, Pact Mock Server does the full string match; GraphQL request is a string).
  One way out would be to always "minify" (remove all whitespace and newlines) the GraphQL queries and mutations
  before sending the requests.
